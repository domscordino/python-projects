Add a remove method to the hash table program.  The method, remove(self, key) will search for the hash item with key and delete it if it finds it.  If it does not find it, it will print out a message that it was not there.  The bookâ€™s hash table code is attached. Write a main method to test your hash table and its remove method.  Make the size of the hash table ten.  Enter, removed, search and enter elements, demonstrating that the remove method works correctly.
