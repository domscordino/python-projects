Create a function which will calculate the cost of a paint job.   It does this by having the user input the square feet of wall to be painted and the cost of each gallon of paint.   It will then print out the data listed in the book.
You are to create a function TotalCost.  This function accepts the price of a gallon of paint and the number of square feet needed to do the job.  The function will then calculate the number of gallons needed and the various costs.   It will then print out the required data, correctly labelled and formatted.
Your program will have a main function which will input the cost of the paint and the number of square feet to be painted.  It will pass this down to the function TotalCost.
Have the program ask the user, “Do you want to estimate the cost of a painting job -y/n?”   If the user enters y, the program will prompt for data and output the costs.   If the user enters n, the program will stop.
