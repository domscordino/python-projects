Create a class DTSSortedList.   DTSSortedList is derived from the class Singlylinkedlist.  There will be two differences between Singly_Linked_List and your derived list. The method append(self, data) will append the data into the list in numerical order.  (Add only numeric data to the list.) The method __set__(self, index)  will be disabled. You will need to test this class in a main method.  It will test all the methods of the class.
