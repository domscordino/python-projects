Create a hot dog cookout calculator.   The program will ask the user how many persons will attend the cookout and how many hotdogs will be given to each person. The program will then calculate the minimum number of packages of hotdogs and the minimum number of packages of buns the user needs to purchase with the minimum number of leftovers and display these number, properly labelled.   The program will also display the number of hot dogs and buns left over.  Hot dogs come in packages of 10 and buns in packages of 8.
