Input an unspecified number of positive integers   Once you enter a negative number, the program stops accepting numbers and outputs the sum of the positive numbers, properly labelled.
Design the program to halt when 0 is entered.  If a person enters a negative integer, an error message will be displayed, the negative number will not be added to the sum, and the program will prompt for the next integer.
