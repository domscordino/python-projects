Create the class DTSComplex.  This class will simulate complex numbers.    The class will have one class variable, __num_of_complex  and two instance variables, __real and __imag. __num_complex displays the number of complex objects that exist in the program.  It is initially set to 0. __real will store an int and represent the real part of the complex number. __imag will store an int and represent the imaginary part of the complex number. The class will contain these  instance methods, __init__, __repr__, __del__, __mul__, and __add__. __init__(self, real, imag) will set __real and __imag to the values passed down.  It will also increment __num__complex. __repr__(self) will return the string  “a + bi” where a and b are the values contained by __real and __imag. __del__(self) will decrement __num_complex when a DTSComplex object is destroyed. __mul__(self, other) will define complex number multiplication. __add__(self, other) will define complex number addition. 
The class will contain one class method: num_of_complex(cls) returns __num_complex. You will test your class by creating a main method which creates DTSComplex objects and demonstrate each of the methods.   __del__ can be demonstrated by calling num_of_complex(), destroying a DTSComplex object and calling num_of_complex again.
