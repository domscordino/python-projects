Create and test a deque class.  A deque is a list in which one can insert or remove items at either end.   You can only work with one element at a time.  The public methods are: Append(data) which appends data at the right end of the deque, Pop() which removes the data from the right end of the deque, Peek() which returns the data from the right, but does not remove it (If the deque is empty, it returns None), AppendLeft(data) which appends data at the left end of the deque, PopLeft() which removes the data from the left end of the deque, PeekLeft() which returns the data from the left end, but does not remove it (If the deque is empty, it returns None). There are no other public methods for the deque.
You are to implement these methods.  Base the deque on the doubly linked list. Create a main method which creates a deque and tests all the methods.
