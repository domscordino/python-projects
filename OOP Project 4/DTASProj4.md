Write a program that accepts a positive integer and then produces the following patterns.  (Assume 4 has been entered.)

****
***
**
*

****
 ***
  **
   *
 
   *
  **
 ***
****

 (In case the figures are “changed” in the storing, all three of these are right triangles.) 

For the second and third pattern, you may want to first create the patterns using another character for the space.  For example, create this pattern

****

_***

__**

___*

Write the program so that all the patterns print horizontally.   That is, you would have this pattern if four were added.

****__****_____*

***____***____**

**______**___***

*________*__****

You will have one outer loop, which determines the row, and a number of inner loops which control the printing of the * and the spaces.
