Implement a binary search tree. You will also need to implement the code for the inorder, postorder, and preorder traversals. After you get your binary tree class operational you are to create a main that does the following: Create a bst and insert the following numbers in this order 100, 50, 150, 25, 45, 125, 175, 20, 30, 40, 47, 120, 135, 160, and 180. Print out preorder, inorder and postorder traversals, each traversal on its own line. Delete 100.  (This will delete a node with two children) Print out the three traversals as before. Delete 125.  (This will delete a node with one child).  Print out the three traversals as before. Delete 30. (This will delete a leaf)  Print out the three traversals as before. Attached are the bst code and the transversal code that came “with” the book.  They contain many of the methods you will use.  Copy it into your program and work from it.
